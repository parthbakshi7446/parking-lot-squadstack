I have divided the code into multiple classes to access data efficiently and avoid data redundancy.


Note:
    testout.txt file is our input file 
    replace it with the data input you want to test
    java main class contains the path to this testout.text only
    YOU HAVE TO UPDATE THE PATH OF THE LINE NO.-41 FOR THE "testout.txt" FILE ACCORDING TO YOUR SYSTEM 
    SO IT DOESN'T SHOW ERROR FILENOTFOUND 
    
Steps to run the Project:
    1) install from https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/?version=java-14&release=14.0.2+13&os=Linux&bitness=64-bit&architecture=x86&package=jdk-full
    2) git clone https://github.com/parthbakshi7446/parking-lot-squadstack
    3) cd parking-lot-squadstack
    4) JAVAPATH(UPDATEYOURSELF) -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -classpath /home/nimish/IdeaProjects/parking-lot-squadstack/out/production/parking-lot-project com.company.Main
    EXAMPLE:/home/nimish/.jdks/liberica-14.0.2/bin/java 
    from the first link , after download, copy java path and add it here.
