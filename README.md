Parking Lot System:

I have divided the code into multiple classes to access data efficiently and avoid data redundancy.


Note:

    testout.txt file is our input file 

    replace it with the data input you want to test

    java main class contains the path to this testout.text only

    YOU HAVE TO UPDATE THE PATH OF THE LINE NO.-41 FOR THE "testout.txt" FILE ACCORDING TO YOUR SYSTEM 

    SO IT DOESN'T SHOW ERROR FILENOTFOUND 
    
Steps to run the Project:

    1) install java JDK from https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/?version=java-14&release=14.0.2+13&os=Linux&bitness=64-bit&architecture=x86&package=jdk-full
         (select appropriate version for your System)
    
    2) git clone https://github.com/parthbakshi7446/parking-lot-squadstack
    
    3) cd parking-lot-squadstack
    
    4) run: <JAVAPATH> -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -classpath <git-repo-path> com.company.Main
    
    EXAMPLE:
        /home/parth/.jdks/liberica-14.0.2/bin/java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -classpath /home/parth/IdeaProjects/parking-lot-squadstack/out/production/parking-lot-project com.company.Main
    
    from the first link , after download, copy java path and add it here.
    
##Alternate Instruction: 
    
    install jdk from java official website
    install intellij
    run main file directly
    DO not forget to update the path for testout.txt input file
