I have divided the code into multiple classes to access data efficiently and avoid data redundancy.


Steps to run the Project:
    Install Java JDK from official Java Wesbite
    install any java editor and run main file

Note:
    testout.txt file is our input file 
    replace it with the data input you want to test
    java main class contains the relative path to this testout.text only
